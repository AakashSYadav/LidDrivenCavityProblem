# LidDrivenCavityProblem

This repository contains the parts of my semester project in ME5101 Computational Fluid Dynamics course. Here I have simulated the flow taking place in the lid-driven cavity problem.
There two main python files
* `unsteadySteady.py` Contains the simulation for the transient regime
* `steadySteady.py` Contains the simulation for the steady state regime

The below image show the simulation for the unsteady state analysis.

To see the in-depth details and the physics of the problem please refer to the [projectReport.pdf](https://github.com/AakashSYadav/LidDrivenCavityProblem/blob/master/projectReport.pdf)
